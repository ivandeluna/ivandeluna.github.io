    "TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It is widely used for building and training machine learning models, particularly deep learning models. TensorFlow provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that make it easier to develop and deploy machine learning solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: TensorFlow supports both high-level APIs (like Keras) and low-level operations, making it suitable for beginners and experts alike.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: It can run on CPUs, GPUs, and even distributed systems for large-scale training.\n",
    "- **Ecosystem**: TensorFlow offers extensions like TensorFlow Like (for mobile devices), TensorFlow.js (for browser-based applications), and TensorFlow Extended (for production pipelines).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensor Flow is used in a wide range of domains, including:\n",
    "- **Computer Visio**: image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text generation, sentiment analysis, and language translation.\n",
    "- **Finance and Business**: Stock price prediction, fraud detection, customer churn analysis, and sales forecasting.\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Disease diagnosis, medical image analysis, and drug discovery."
